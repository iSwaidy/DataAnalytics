-- 1. Create a single query to list the product id, product name, unit price and category name of all products
--    Order by category name and within that, by product name.
	
    SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, c.CategoryName
	FROM products p
	JOIN categories c 
		ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
	ORDER BY c.CategoryName, p.ProductName;

-- 2. Create a single query to list the product id, product name, unit price and suppliername of all products that cost more than $75.
-- Order by product name.

    SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, s.CompanyName 
		AS SupplierName
	FROM products p
	JOIN suppliers s 
		ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
	WHERE p.UnitPrice > 75
	ORDER BY p.ProductName;

-- 3.  Create a single query to list the product id, product name, unit price, category name, and supplier name of every product. 
-- Order by product name.
	
    SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, c.CategoryName, s.CompanyName 
		AS SupplierName
	FROM products p
	JOIN categories c 
		ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
	JOIN suppliers s 
		ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
	ORDER BY p.ProductName;

-- 4. Create a single query to list the order id, ship name, ship address, and shipping company name of every order that shipped to Germany. 
-- Assign the shipping company name the alias ‘Shipper.’ 
-- Order by the name of the shipper, then the name of who it shipped to.
	
    SELECT o.OrderID, o.ShipName, o.ShipAddress, sh.CompanyName 
		AS Shipper
	FROM orders o
	JOIN shippers sh 
		ON o.ShipVia = sh.ShipperID
	WHERE o.ShipCountry = 'Germany'
	ORDER BY sh.CompanyName, o.ShipName;

-- 5. Start from the same query as above (#4), but omit OrderID and add logic to group by ship name, with a count of how many orders were shipped for that ship name.
	
    SELECT o.ShipName, o.ShipAddress, sh.CompanyName 
		AS Shipper, COUNT(*) 
        AS OrderCount
	FROM orders o
	JOIN shippers sh 
		ON o.ShipVia = sh.ShipperID
	WHERE o.ShipCountry = 'Germany'
	GROUP BY o.ShipName, o.ShipAddress, sh.CompanyName
	ORDER BY sh.CompanyName, o.ShipName;

-- 6. Create a single query to list the order id, order date, ship name, ship address of all orders that included Sasquatch Ale.

	
    SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.ShipName, o.ShipAddress
	FROM orders o
	JOIN `order details` od 
		ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
	JOIN products p 
		ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
	WHERE p.ProductName = 'Sasquatch Ale'
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate;
