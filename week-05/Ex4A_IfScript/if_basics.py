x = 100

# a) If x divided by y is 5, print “x divided by y is 5” and set the value of x to 1 – otherwise print “are the variables set up correctly?”
if x / y == 5:
    print("x divided by y is 5")
    x = 1
else:
    print("are the variables set up correctly?")

# b) If x times y is y, print “now x times y is y” and then set x to 10 – otherwise print “Whoops, x equals” + the value of x
if x * y == y:
    print("now x times y is y")
    x = 10
else:
    print("Whoops, x equals " + str(x))

# c) If x is less than y, print “x is less than y” and double the value of x – otherwise print “uh oh, x is not less than y”
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
    x = x * 2
else:
    print("uh oh, x is not less than y")

# d) If x is greater than y, print “how is x greater than y??” otherwise print “x is NOT greater than y”
if x > y:
    print("how is x greater than y??")
else:
    print("x is NOT greater than y")

# e) Add a final print statement to say “The final value of x is __ and the final value of y is __” (displaying the actual values in place of the blanks)
print(f"The final value of x is {x} and the final value of y is {y}")
